A client told me to make custom message for "Customer Chat Plugin" ...

Chatfuel doesn't allow users to make changes like :

- Logged in message
- Logged Out message
- Colors..

So, I made this tool for free.. you can make your custom Chat plugin..

Q: How is this working ?
A: Easy : 

1. Go to your chatfuel bot, open "Grow" tab, open "Customer Chat Plugin for Your Website" and get your code

2. Open https://ademking.github.io/Advanced-Chatfuel-Customer-Chat-Plugin/

3. Paste your code and modify the "logged-in", "logged-out" and "Color"

4. Click "Generate" Button..

That's it â™¥ Hope you like it
